"""
    Create a display surface and caption it. 
    
	Create 10 balls, each at different location and with different radius.
	Let each 1 second the radius of ball shrink a little bit.
	Once the radius is below certain threshold, the ball will disappear and
	a new ball will appear at a new random location.
	
	Make following or similar features:
	1. As the radius is shrinking, the ball is fading to black. Imagine that
	  the balls represent starts and they are fading into darkness ;)))
	2. Each ball should be moving into different direction. Once they hit the
	  boundary of screen, you can send it into different "random" direction.
	3. Add some additional cool functionality.
