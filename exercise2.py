"""
    Create a display surface and caption it. Download an image of a small ball and
    import that image into your program.
    Create a wall of some thickness all around the display surface, i.e., a
    perimeter along the display surface with a different color than your background.
    Make the initial position of the ball random, i.e., the ball's initial position
    should vary every time your code is run.
    
    Write code such that the ball keeps bouncing between these four walls either
    logically or arbitrarily.
    
    Also, write a code that counts the number of bounces on "each" wall, displays
    this count at a corner of your surface, and keeps updating the count as the
    ball keeps bouncing.
    
    Bonus-1: Attempt the same with multiple balls at a time on the surface.
    Bonus-2: Add other cool functionalities such as varying speed after a bounce, etc.

    Note: Try to play around with colors as well. Also play with the frame speed.
    Hint: Recall that any action can be performed by writing code for various events.
            How to code a ball that bounces off of all four walls?
